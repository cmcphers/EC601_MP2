# EC601_MP2

1. Introduction:

These are two simple binary classifiers for images.  They determine 
whether the item in the image is a piano or a drum set. 

2. System Requirements:

The programs here require the following Python libraries to be installed:

    a. numpy
    b. matplotlib
    c. PIL (pillow)
    d. tensorflow

Tensorflow requires Python 3.5.0 or 3.6.0.  For Mac OSX, it requires at
Mac OS 10.12 (Sierra)

3. Instructions

    i. Begin by installing the required libraries mentioned in section 2.
        a. pip install numpy
        b. pip install matplotlib
        c. pip install pil
        d. pip install tensorflow

    ii. Then, unzip 'training_small.zip' and 'test_small.zip.'  These are the training and test         sets, respectively.

    iii. Run 'MP02_DenseModel.py' to run the fully-connected neural network model.

    iv. Run 'MP02_CNNModel.py' to run the convolutional nerual network model.
